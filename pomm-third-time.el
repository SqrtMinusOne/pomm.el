;;; Commentary:

;; This is an implementation of the third time technique.  Take a look
;; at the `pomm-third-time' function for the general idea.
;;
;; This file reuses some parts from the main `pomm' file, but a lot of
;; functionality is duplicated.

  "Implementation of the Third Time timer in Emacs.

The idea of the technique is as follows:
- Work as long as you need, take a break as 1/3 of the work time (the
  fraction of work time to break time is set in
  `pomm-third-time-fraction')
- If you've ended a break early, unused break time is saved and added
  to the next break within the same session.
- If you've finished the session, either to take a longer break or to
  end working, remaining break time is discarded.  Each session starts
  from a clean slate.

The timer can have two states:
- Stopped.
  Can be started with \\='s' or `pomm-third-time-start'.
- Running.
  Can be stopped with \\='S' or `pomm-third-time-stop'.

If the timer is running, the current period type (work or break) can
be switched by \\='b' or `pomm-third-time-switch'.  If the break time
runs out, the timer automatically switches to work.

The timer supports setting \"context\", for example, a task on which
you\\='re working on.  It can be set with \\='-c' or
`pomm-third-time-set-context'.  This is useful together with CSV
logging, which is enabled if `pomm-third-time-csv-history-file' is
non-nil.

Enable `pomm-mode-line-mode' to display the timer state in the
modeline."
